# nixconf

I've been using NixOS since 22 June 2024. This is the config I run on all my systems. I am very much not an expert, so I would suggest you reference others before mine.

## Credits

No project is done alone. This is especially so in the FOSS World. I would like to credit and thank the following people for sharing their configuration, wisdom, or thoughts with me:

[Vimjoyer](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer), for his videos

[Viper](https://github.com/viperML), especially for his blogposts, but also for his projects like [nh](https://github.com/viperML/nh)

[lychee](https://github.com/itslychee), for help on Discord

[Not A Shelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf), both on Discord and through his now archived Nix config that I have referenced for this README and for directory structure

This list will be sure to grow.
