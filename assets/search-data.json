[{"id":"0","title":"README","content":"PatchELF is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF executables and  libraries.  In particular, it can do the following: Change the dynamic loader (\"ELF interpreter\") of executables: Change the   of executables and libraries: Shrink the   of executables and libraries: This removes from the   all directories that do not contain a  library referenced by   fields of the executable or library.  For instance, if an executable references one library  , has  an RPATH  , and   can only be found  in  , then the new   will be  . In addition, the   option can be used for  further rpath tuning. For instance, if an executable has an   , it is probably desirable to keep  the   reference instead of the   entry. To accomplish  that, use: Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries (  entries): This option can be given multiple times. Add a declared dependency on a dynamic library ( ): This option can be give multiple times. Replace a declared dependency on a dynamic library with another one  ( ): This option can be give multiple times. Change   of a dynamic library: Compiling and Testing Via Autotools Via Nix You can build with Nix in several ways. Building via   will produce the result in  .

This for instance allows  gdb to show proper backtraces. Added  ` --remove-needed' option. 0.6 (November 7, 2011): Hacky support for executables created by the Gold linker. Support segments with an alignment of 0 (contributed by Zack  Weinberg). Added a manual page (contributed by Jeremy Sanders  jeremy@jeremysanders.net ). 0.5 (November 4, 2009): Various bugfixes. ` --force-rpath' now deletes the DT_RUNPATH if it is present. 0.4 (June 4, 2008): Support for growing the RPATH on dynamic libraries. IA-64 support (not tested) and related 64-bit fixes. FreeBSD support. --shrink-rpath' and  --force-rpath' is specified.  If  neither is present, a DT_RUNPATH is added unless  ` --force-rpath' is  specified, in which case a DT_RPATH is added. 0.3 (May 24, 2007): Support for 64-bit ELF binaries (such as on x86_64-linux). Support for big-endian ELF binaries (such as on powerpc-linux). Various bugfixes. 0.2 (January 15, 2007): Provides a hack to get certain programs (such as the  Belastingaangifte 2005) to work. 0.1 (October 11, 2005): Initial release.
