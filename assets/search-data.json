[{"id":"0","title":"Lunix","content":"Lunix [ !IMPORTANT ]  Please star my repository if you find it helpful in your own configuration.  It's free. Named \"Lunix\" as a portmanteau of my username, \"Lunarnova,\" and \"Nix,\" Lunix is  my NixOS configuration I use on all my systems and plan to use on all future  systems. Having used NixOS since 22 June 2024, Lunix has gone through many, many  iterations and has become a passion project of mine. I am sure that, likewise,  it will continue to be iterated upon, improved, and expanded. I have learned so much from it. I look forward to learning more. [ !CAUTION ]  I do not support you using my flake in your own systems. It is not designed  for that. I am not keeping it in mind for my development. I strongly  discourage using someone else's flakes in your configuration. Learn Nix, or  don't use NixOS. Structure Lunix is structured specifically to be logical and help me work with it. Here's  a basic rundown:  Nix Flake: The entry-point of my system.  Flake Modules: The parts of my flake that make up the whole, powered  by  Flake Parts .  Nixpkgs Overlay: Custom mkDerivations written by yours truly.  System specific configuration: Mainly hardware configuration and  specific option selection, especially defining the profiles.  Modular system configuration: The bulk of my system configuration.  Modules that are generally made available to all my hosts.  Desktop modules: Desktops installed and configured.  Profile modules: Special programs, services, and configuration  needed on each profile.  Agenix Secrets Management. How the profiles work Each profile has its own options for enabling and disabling apps and  installing programs. Each host can select which profiles' modules to import. The profile itself can be enabled or disabled, and this sets the default  option of its programs to be enabled or disabled by default. Credit to  @NotAShelf  for inspiration and references. Why don't you use Home Manager? Home Manager  is a lovely tool for many people that helps manage their dotfiles  for them. I used it myself for the first 6 months of my journey on NixOS. I then  decided it was best to move away from it. With  @NotAShelf  and  @éclairevoyant 's  Hjem , I successfully migrated from Home Manager and began  managing my dotfiles myself. Home Manager has a few problems for me: Abstracts too much, Lengthens eval times, and Can be a nightmare to work with. In the past, I believed its capabilities were worth the costs. Ultimately,  however, I found an alternate solution and have never looked back. If you wish to do the same, I would consider this configuration to be a decent  jumping-off point. You may also want to keep an eye on my currently WIP  Hjem Rum , a module collection for Hjem, offering options similar to Home  Manager. This solves the latter two issues while acknowledging the fact that for  many, the first issue is not a bug but a feature. I have a million other questions :c For a while, I tried to document and explain any quirky choices I made in my  configuration. But at this point, I'm past my limit, and I'm adding more  insanity to it by the week. While I have done my best to (and, I believe, a good  job of) explaining my wacky decisions in the code with comments, if you still  find yourself questioning yours or my sanity, or simply are struck by a wave of  curiosity, feel free to reach out to me. Hosts Name Description Profiles Type polaris Primary daily-driver: the first system I installed NixOS on. Gaming, Workstation Desktop procyon Framework 13 laptop with a Ryzen 7040. Workstation Laptop Related Projects Most people maintain everything in a monorepo―I am not one of those people. I  began fracturing my Nix project(s) by starting my Neovim configuration in a  separate repo, titled  Novavim . I then realized that it would be nice to have  full access to my extended library without needing to input my whole NixOS  configuration. Thus,  Lunar's Libraries  was born. Novavim I moved my Neovim configuration into another repo primarily in order to make it  easy for me to use it on any system without needing access to my NixOS  configuration, and without needing to fully update to a newest version of my  configuration (for when I make large, in-progress changes), and instead allow  myself to simply run it from another repo. It is also a bit helpful as it allows me to more mentally separate the projects.  While I use Nix to configure my Neovim, I view Novavim as a self-contained  project, rather than as a part of my broader NixOS configuration. You can see more information over in  Novavim . Lunar's (Nix) Libraries Rather than maintain my full extended library within this singular monorepo, I  moved it into its own as well. Initially, this was so that I could use a  function both in Lunix and in Novavim without needing to input Lunix, with all  its unwieldy inputs and modules. Additionally, I simply find the mental  separation to be gratifying. My extended library is a  toolset , not a component  of my configurations, whether in Lunix or Novavim. You can see more information over in  Lunar's Libraries . Credits No project is done alone. This is especially so in the FOSS World. I would like  to credit and thank the following people for sharing their configuration,  wisdom, or knowledge: The Originators of My Passion @0atman , whose NixOS video first got me interested in the space. @vimjoyer , for his videos, and for his public nixconf, which I learned and  referenced for my own configuration early on. SNUG @NotAShelf , for enough reasons that I am certain to leave something out. For  his now archived  Nyx , for the extensive help and patience he has given me, and  for being insane enough to do a lot that I have learned from. Much of my  configuration is heavily inspired by his. @PolarFill , for collaborating with me on  Hjem Rum  and providing me with his  thoughts. @nezia1 , also for collaborating with me on  Hjem Rum , as well as for being a  cool person. Many other members from  SNUG , who have collaborated with me on projects like  Hjem Rum  and also allowed me to engage with community to further pursue Nix. Other members of the NixOS community @viperML , especially for his blogposts from which I learned to write  mkDerivations, but also for his projects like  nh . @itslychee , for help on Discord. This list will be sure to grow, and I have probably missed people. So to  everyone else I have interacted with on my Nix journey, thank you.
